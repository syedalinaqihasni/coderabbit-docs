This guide will assist you in effectively integrating CodeRabbit with Azure
DevOps.

## Prerequisites

- An active Azure DevOps account.
- Use of organizational email addresses is required; personal email addresses
  are not supported for this integration.

## Integration Instructions

1. Log in to the CodeRabbitAI application.
2. After logging in, you will be redirected to a page displaying Microsoft Apps
   consent requests. Please forward these requests to your administrator for
   approval.

   :::warning

   If you are an administrator, you may approve the applications directly. If not,
   please contact your administrator to request approval for the applications.

3. Once your administrator has approved the applications, click "Continue."
4. You will be redirected to the "Onboarding" page, where you can select the
   organization you wish to integrate with.
5. On the "Azure DevOps User" page, enter your Personal Access Token for Azure
   DevOps.

6. To install CodeRabbit on a repository, toggle the switch on the
   "Repositories" page.

## How it works

For the CodeRabbit app to post reviews on merge requests, it needs to interact
with the Azure DevOps API, which requires a Personal Access Token. This token
can be generated by creating a Personal Access Token from one of your existing
users.

You can create a new user in Azure DevOps and generate a Personal Access Token
for that user, following [our recommendations](#recommendations).

## Azure DevOps Personal Access Tokens

To interact with the Azure DevOps API, a **Personal Access Token** is required.
This token can be generated by creating a **Personal Access Token** from one of
your existing users.

Upon first login to the application (immediately after the onboarding screen),
you will need to add the Personal Access Token.

### Recommendations

- **Create a dedicated user for CodeRabbit** - This ensures the user is
  exclusively for CodeRabbit, allowing better access control.
- **Use "CodeRabbit" as the username** - This makes the user easily recognizable
  for future reference.
- **Use a dedicated email address** - This helps in easy identification and
  management.
- **Use the CodeRabbit logo as the profile picture** - This further ensures easy
  recognition. You can download our logo from
  [here](/img/integrations/logo.png "download").

### Key Points to Remember

- Personal access tokens have expiration dates. Ensure the expiration date
  covers the duration of your intended use of the CodeRabbit app.
- Code reviews will be attributed to the owner of the personal access token.
- If the personal access token expires, you can add a new one via the CodeRabbit
  UI:
  - Navigate to the "AzureDevOps User" page in the sidebar.
  - Add the new token and click save.

### Generating a Personal Access Token

Azure DevOps provides an option to generate a personal access token for a user.
Follow these steps to generate the token:

1. Log in as the user intended for CodeRabbit reviews.
2. Next to your avatar on the headers right side is a settings icon, click it.
3. Choose "Personal Access Tokens"
4. Click "New Token"
5. Select the organization you want to use the token with or select "All
   accessible organizations."
6. Enter a name and an expiry date for the token.
7. We need to have read & write access to "Work Items" & "Code" to post reviews
   on pull requests. If you are on the Pro tier also add "Build" access for pipeline
   failure remediation.
8. Click "Create"
