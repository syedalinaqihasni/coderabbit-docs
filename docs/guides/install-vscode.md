This page is about installing the CodeRabbit VSCode extension. For more information about the extension, see
[Review local changes](/code-editors).

:::note
The instructions on this page are specific to using the extension with VSCode. If you are instead using a VSCode-compatible editor such as Cursor or Windsurf, then the steps that you need to follow are similar, but might require some adaptation.

## Before you begin

Before you can use the CodeRabbit VSCode extension, you need a CodeRabbit account.

If you don't already have an account, you can create one by visiting [the CodeRabbit login page](https://app.coderabbit.ai/login).

## Install the extension

To install the CodeRabbit extension, follow these steps:

1. In the editor activity bar, click **Extensions**.

1. In sidebar, type `coderabbit` into the **Search Extensions in Marketplace** search bar. After a moment, **CodeRabbit** appears in the sidebar as a search result.

1. Select **CodeRabbit**. A summary of the CodeRabbit VSCode extension appears in the window's main pane, along with installation controls.

1. If you would like your editor to automatically check for and apply future updates to the extension, then keep the **Auto Update** checkbox selected. Otherwise, clear the checkbox.

1. Click **Install**.

1. A **Log in to CodeRabbit to get started** dialog appears. Click **Login**. If the dialog gets dismissed or times out first, then you can follow these alternate steps:

   1. Click the CodeRabbit icon in the VSCode activity bar.

   1. Click the **Use CodeRabbit for Free** button.

1. Grant VSCode permission to open your browser, if asked.

1. In your web browser, log into your CodeRabbit account.

This connects your CodeRabbit account with the CodeRabbit VSCode extension.

## Install using the marketplace website

If you are using the VSCode IDE, and not an IDE that derives from it such as Cursor or Windsurf, then you can alternatively obtain and install the CodeRabbit VSCode extension by visiting [the extension's page on the Visual Studio Marketplace](https://coderabbit.link/vscode-docs).

If you do install the extension this way, then you still need to connect your CodeRabbit account to the extension after installing it, as described in the previous section.
