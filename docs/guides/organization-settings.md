This page is about managing the default settings of CodeRabbit across your
whole Git platform organization.

For a general overview of configuring CodeRabbit, see [Configure CodeRabbit](/guides/configuration-overview).

## About organization settings {#about}

You can use the CodeRabbit web interface to set the CodeRabbit configuration
for all of the Git repositories associated with your organization. By default, all of your repositories apply your organization's CodeRabbit configuration.

You have the option to define separate settings for some or
all of your individual repositories, instead. For more information, see [Set your repository preferences](/guides/repository-settings).

## Browse and modify your organization settings {#modify}

To view or modify your organizational settings, follow these steps:

1. Visit [the CodeRabbit web interface](https://app.coderabbit.ai/settings/repositories).
1. In the sidebar, click **Organization Settings** > **Configuration**.
1. Browse and modify the settings as needed. If you do make changes, click **Apply Changes** when you are finished.
