# 🚀 Future Developments

We are actively iterating and refining CodeRabbit, and this is a sneak peek into the upcoming milestones and releases. We are focused on making the Applied AI review better than the median manual review. In addition to that, we are looking at a holistic user experience with various integrations and types of reviews.

## 🧠 Applied AI Improvements

We are actively trying to make the application of Generative AI more useful , relevant , meaningful for the coder and reviewer journey. Our immediate focus is 

### 🎯 Accuracy and Conciseness Enhancements

- 📝 Refining knowledge base context understanding
- 📊 Implementing advanced summarization techniques
- 🔄 Implementing a knowledge base feature library 

### 🧠 Learning Refinements

- 🔁 We have made significant improvement of the learning Enhancing reinforcement learning based on the user feedback

## 🌟 New Feature Enhancements

### 🔗 Expanded Integrations

We are integrating various tool chains to enable coders and reviewers to have a consistent experience irrespective of the tools. The immediate tools would be:

- 🦊 **Bitbucket**
- 🔄 **Circle CI**
- 👨‍🔧 **Jenkins**

### 💬 Communication Tool Integrations

Communication and the user experience of review via various communication tools are going to be key. We will start with integrations to Slack and Microsoft Teams and will be diving into the design engineering of these flows further:

- 💬 **Slack**: Real-time notifications and interactive discussions
- 👥 **Microsoft Teams**: Code review conversations within Microsoft ecosystem

### 🔍 Enhanced Review Capabilities

These are additional capabilities that can also be reviewed in the same PR to accelerate the coder and reviewer journey. This includes pipeline failure analysis and resolution, as well as vulnerability assessment.

#### 1. 🔬 Pipeline Failure Analysis

- 🚨 Automated analysis of CI/CD pipeline failures
- 💡 AI-driven suggestions for resolving issues
- 📊 Historical tracking of pipeline performance

#### 2. 🛡️ SAST (Static Application Security Testing) Integration

- 🔒 Security-focused code reviews
- 📋 Custom rule sets for different security standards

### 🚀 Finishing Touches

 Finishing touches are about experience that often take developers time away from what they like doing best - coding. But adding finishing touches is crucial and should follow the ontology and taxonomy. We will start by looking into Docstring and expand to various areas to solve pain points for coders and reviewers.

#### 1. 📝 DocString Review

- ✅ Automated checks for docstring presence and quality
- 💡 AI-powered suggestions for improving documentation
- 🎨 Resolving Doc-string conflicts in a following PR
