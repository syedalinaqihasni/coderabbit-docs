# Introduction

This page provides a conceptual introduction to CodeRabbit. For a hands-on tutorial, see [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart/).

**CodeRabbit** is an AI-powered code reviewer that delivers context-aware feedback on pull requests within minutes, reducing the time and effort needed for manual code reviews. It complements manual reviews by providing a fresh perspective and catching issues that manual reviews often miss, enhancing the overall review quality.

Developers can interact directly with the CodeRabbit bot within their existing Git platform's pull request interface to add context, ask questions, or even have the bot generate code. Over time, CodeRabbit learns from user input and improves its suggestions.

## Core features

Core CodeRabbit features include the following:

- Integrates rapidly with popular Git platforms and workflows.
- Applies dozens of open-source, industry-standard code analyzers to every commit.
- Implements code reviews as familiar pull-request comments.
- Works with contributors through natural-language conversation in comments.
- Learns and adapts to your team's code style and review preferences.
- Provides an observability dashboard of code-contribution activity.
- Practices strong privacy and security, with no retention of analyzed code.
- Offers free use for public repositories, and flexible pricing for private codebases.

## Seamless workflow integration

CodeRabbit shares its reviews as comments attached to pull requests, using the same Git platform that your team already uses. Further commits in the same pull review prompt CodeRabbit to make further reviews, using the earlier reviews as context.

Each time that it performs a code review, CodeRabbit runs the relevant code changes through [an array of industry-standard code linters, security analyzers, and other tools](/tools/). CodeRabbit synthesizes the output of these tools into its reviews, offering a high-level analysis that can suggest areas for further focus and improvement.

Your team can have conversations with CodeRabbit about its reviews by replying to it with follow-up comments on pull requests, asking it questions or making observations about the review using natural language. CodeRabbit continues the conversation appropriately, offering further insights about the code changes, or adjusting its own review style based on feedback.

### Customizable review preferences

As you interact with CodeRabbit through chat, it learns the review preferences of your team, and applies them to all future reviews on a given repository.

For example, if CodeRabbit uses a linter to suggest that your pull request use four-space indentations, but your team uses a two-space indentation style, then you can reply to CodeRabbit's pull-request comment to tell it exactly that. CodeRabbit acknowledges your feedback and adjusts all of its subsequent reviews with that repository appropriately.

For a video introduction to this feature, see [CodeRabbit Learnings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu0cmmOYA-U).

If you need to fine-tune CodeRabbit's behavior beyond this, then you can [add a CodeRabbit-specific configuration file](/getting-started/configure-coderabbit) to your repository, or use the CodeRabbit web UI to set further preferences. This file can include [path-based instructions](/guides/review-instructions) for how CodeRabbit should review different files within your codebase.

No matter how you tune and customize CodeRabbit, its default settings make it useful out of the box, able to meaningfully review pull requests within minutes of its introduction to a repository.

### Git platform integration

CodeRabbit integrates in just a few clicks with many popular Git platforms:

- GitHub, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, GitHub Enterprise Server,
- GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed
- Azure DevOps
- Bitbucket Cloud

For more information, see [Supported Git Platforms](/platforms/).

### Issue-management integration

You can integrate CodeRabbit with issue-management platforms. This lets you ask CodeRabbit to create tickets during code reviews, or chat with CodeRabbit about your code from within issue comments. Compatible platforms include the following:

- GitHub Issues
- GitLab Issues
- Jira
- Linear

For more information, see [Issue Creation](/guides/issue-creation) and [Issue Chat](/guides/issue-chat).

## Data privacy and security

CodeRabbit collects only the minimum amount of information needed to provide you with our code review services. Our privacy and security posture centers around protecting your data through ephemerality:

- All queries to large language models (LLMs) exist in-memory only, with zero retention after each query completes.
- We don't use your code, code reviews, or other collected data to train LLMs.
- CodeRabbit doesn't share any collected customer data with third parties.
- We keep all customer data confidential, and isolated by organization.
- Our data collection and storage practices comply with SOC 2 and GDPR standards.

For more information about how we protect your data, see [the CodeRabbit Trust Center](https://trust.coderabbit.ai).

## Flexible pricing, free for public repositories

Public repositories can use the Pro tier of CodeRabbit at no charge, including all of the code-review features described on this page. Rate limits might apply.

For private repositories, a number of pricing tiers are available. These range from a Free tier that offers unlimited code-change summaries, to an Enterprise tier with access to advanced features and SLA support. For more information, see [Pricing](https://www.coderabbit.ai/pricing).

## Review local changes from within VSCode

As a separate, free product, CodeRabbit offers a VSCode extension that brings a subset of core CodeRabbit features to VSCode. This lets you use the power of CodeRabbit to tune and tidy your code changes locally before pushing your changes into a formal pull request for more thorough reviews.

For more information, see [Review local changes](/code-editors).
