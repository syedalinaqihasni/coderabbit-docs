- `@coderabbitai full review`: Conducts a full review from scratch, covering all files again
- `@coderabbitai summary`: Regenerates the summary of the PR
- `@coderabbitai configuration`: Displays the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository

#### Improved Handling of Closed PRs

We have been observing that many PRs get closed quickly and CodeRabbit continues to review them. PRs get closed quickly for various reasons - changes are too small, the author is confident (perhaps, overly?), or the changes were unnecessary. With this improvement, we now stop the review process midway if we detect that the PR has been closed.

---

## May 23, 2024

### New Features and Improvements

#### Review Settings

Users can now select between **Chill** and **Assertive** review tones to tailor feedback styles according to their preferences. The **Assertive** profile posts more comments and nitpicks the code more aggressively, while the **Chill** profile is more relaxed and posts fewer comments.

#### More Static Analysis Support

We are continually expanding our support for static analysis tools. We've recently added support for

- Biome
- Hadolint
- ast-grep.

Update your .coderabbit.yaml file or visit the settings page to enable or disable the tools you wish to use.

#### Tone Settings

Users can now personalize CodeRabbit to review code in the style of their favorite characters or personalities. Here are a few of our top examples:

- Mr. T: "You must talk like Mr. T in all your code reviews. I pity the fool who doesn't!"
- Pirate: "Arr, matey! Ye must talk like a pirate in all yer code reviews. Yarrr!"
- Snarky Ex-Girlfriend: "You must talk like a snarky ex-girlfriend in all your code reviews. You're welcome."

#### Revamped Settings Page

We have redesigned the settings page for a more intuitive layout, enabling users to find and adjust settings quickly. This change was long-time coming; it not only improves the user experience but also allows our development team to add more settings in the future with ease. Going forward, the changes to .coderabbit.yaml will be reflected in the settings page, and vice versa.

---

## April 18, 2024

### Static Analyzers and Linters Integration

CodeRabbit now runs static analyzers, linters and provides one-click fixes for the issues identified. AI helps reduce the false positives and focus on the critical findings. CodeRabbit will respect the existing configuration files of these tools if they already exist in the project. For example, if your project already uses ruff and has a ruff.toml file at the root of the project, that will be used. In cases where project configurations are not found, CodeRabbit defaults will be used. Currently, CodeRabbit runs markdownlint, shellcheck, ruff, and languagetool. We will continue to add more tools. The default configuration can be changed through the .coderabbit.yaml file.

Are there any specific tools you'd like us to add? Let us know. We'd love to hear your suggestions!

### YML File Customization

CodeRabbit customizations made easy! You can now customize CodeRabbit using a YML file from your repository. To learn more, refer to our comprehensive documentation on customizing CodeRabbit.

---

## September 21, 2023

### Path-Based Review Instructions

This section explains how to add custom code review instructions for the entire project or specific file paths in your project using glob patterns. Developers can provide tailored review guidelines based on the file paths. These instructions are needed only if you want the reviewer to follow specific instructions besides the standard review.

Adding file path prompts allows developers to specify custom instructions for different parts of the codebase. For example, you may want to enforce style guide by file types or directories.

Sample Usage:

```yaml
path: **/*.js
instructions: Review the javascript code against the google javascript style guide and point out any mismatches
```

```yaml
path: tests/**.*
instructions: Review the following unit test code written using the Mocha test library. Ensure that: The code adheres to best practices associated with Mocha. Descriptive test names are used to clearly convey the intent of each test.
```

> Note:
>
> - Paths accept glob patterns
> - Instructions generally work well for specific additional instructions. However, they are not that effective if you are instructing AI not to do something
> - Test the review feedback on pull requests and tailor as necessary
